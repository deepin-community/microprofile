  * d/rules: convert README to HTML.
    HTML documentation is more in line with section 12.4 of the Debian
    Policy. The generated HTML document uses highlight.js to highlight code
    blocks and CSS' color-scheme property to adapt to the user's color
    scheme preference.
  * d/rules: exclude Visual Studio files from the examples
  * d/patches: simplify visibility patch

  [ Andrea Pappacoda ]
  * New upstream version 4.0+dfsg
  * d/control: libmicroprofile3 -> libmicroprofile4
  * d/copyright: exclude non-free JavaScript code
  * d/copyright: also mention the Unlicense license.
    Upstream originally used the Unlicense, but later relicensed under the
    MIT license. Between the 3.1 and 4.0 releases, though, a third party
    contributor submitted a patch adding a new LICENSE file including the
    Unlicense, and the patch was merged. It is now unclear which portions
    are licensed under the MIT and which ones under the Unlicense (if any),
    so I've marked all the code as licensed under both. It shouldn't matter
    anyway, as the Unlicense is a public domain-equivalent license.
  * d/patches: drop and refresh patches
  * d/patches: replace non-free JavaScript code (Closes: #1023178)

  [ Debian Janitor ]
  * Set upstream metadata fields: Bug-Submit.
